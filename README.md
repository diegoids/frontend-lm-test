========

HTML mobile page for company on Lovemondays' website using:
* **NPM** as Package Manager
* **GULP** to automated task
* **HTML5**
* **CSS3** with **SASS**
* **AngularJS**

I've decided to use:
* **NPM** because there are a lots of updated packages in a simple and fast way to use
* **GULP** because helps to configure and run tasks
* **SASS** because it become the CSS more organized and easier to maintain
* **AngularJS** because there are a good documentation, lots of content and discussion on web and help to develop a MVC application
